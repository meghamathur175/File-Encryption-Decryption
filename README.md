This project implements a File Encryption and Decryption application using AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) in Java. It allows users to securely encrypt and decrypt files with symmetric encryption, ensuring confidentiality and data integrity.

# The program allows users to:

Encrypt and decrypt files based on user input.
Handle symmetric encryption using AES in different modes.
Ensure proper key sizes (16, 24, or 32 bytes) for AES encryption.
Efficiently process file data using Java NIO (New I/O) for file handling.
Demonstrate the use of Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) for cryptographic operations.

# Key Features:
AES Symmetric Encryption: Implements encryption and decryption using AES algorithm, ensuring data confidentiality.
Java NIO for File Handling: Uses Java NIO for efficient reading and writing of files during encryption and decryption processes.
Key Size Validation: Ensures that the encryption key is valid (16, 24, or 32 bytes), preventing errors related to invalid keys.
User-Friendly Interface: Interactive command-line interface (CLI) for file path and key input, making it easy to use.

# Technologies Used:
Java (Core Java)
AES Encryption
Java NIO (New I/O)
Java Cryptography Extension (JCE)

This project demonstrates the application of cryptographic techniques for file security, offering a practical example of how cryptography can be used to protect sensitive data.
